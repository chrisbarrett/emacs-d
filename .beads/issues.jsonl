C-c C-k aborts and closes the buffer\n5. C-c C-c sends buffer contents to a Claude Code one-shot session running in the repo root\n6. Claude Code creates the bd issue based on the description\n7. Display desktop notification when issue is successfully created\n\nThis provides a natural way to leverage Claude's understanding to create well-structured issues without leaving Emacs, and integrates smoothly with the existing worktree workflow.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T17:10:13.83745+13:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T12:44:40.183074+13:00","closed_at":"2025-10-30T13:48:09.309338+13:00"}
