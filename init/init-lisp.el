;;; init-lisp.el --- DEPRECATED: Migrated to modules/lang-lisp/ -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/lang-lisp/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/lang-lisp/init.el
;; - Eval and test commands autoloaded from modules/lang-lisp/lib.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-lisp.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/lang-lisp/")

(provide 'init-lisp)

;;; init-lisp.el ends here
