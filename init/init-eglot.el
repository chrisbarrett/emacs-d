;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/eglot/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/eglot/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-eglot.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/eglot/")

(provide 'init-eglot)

;;; init-eglot.el ends here
