;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/claude/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-claude.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/claude/")

(provide 'init-claude)

;;; init-claude.el ends here
