;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/evil/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-evil.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/evil/")

(provide 'init-evil)

;;; init-evil.el ends here
