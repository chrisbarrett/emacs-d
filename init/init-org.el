;;; init-org.el --- DEPRECATED: Migrated to modules/org/ -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/org/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - Core org-mode functionality is now in modules/org/init.el
;; - Agenda functionality is in modules/org-agenda/init.el
;; - Capture functionality is in modules/org-capture/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-org.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/org/")

(provide 'init-org)

;;; init-org.el ends here
