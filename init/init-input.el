;;; init-input.el --- DEPRECATED: Migrated to modules/input-methods/ and modules/evil/ -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/input-methods/ and modules/evil/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - Input method configuration is in modules/input-methods/init.el
;; - Editing commands (puni, electric-pair) are in modules/evil/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-input.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/input-methods/ and modules/evil/")

(provide 'init-input)

;;; init-input.el ends here
