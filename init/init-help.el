;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/help/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/help/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-help.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/help/")

(provide 'init-help)

;;; init-help.el ends here
