;;; Extra UI & session lifecycle hooks

;; These hooks are cribbed from Doom--they're a great pattern for deferred
;; loading.

;; The first set are *transient* hooks; they are run only once in the Emacs
;; session, the first time a particular action is performed by the user.

(defvar +first-input-hook nil
  "Transient hook before first user input.")

(defvar +first-file-hook nil
  "Transient hook before first interactively opened file.")

(defvar +first-buffer-hook nil
  "Transient hook before first interactively opened buffer.")

;; These are set up to run just once by other hooks.

(+run-hook-once '+first-file-hook '(find-file-hook dired-initial-position-hook))

;; The remaining hooks are executed routinely throughout the session.

(defvar +switch-buffer-hook nil
