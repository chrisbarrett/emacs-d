;;; init-debug.el --- DEPRECATED: Migrated to modules/debug/ -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; DEPRECATED: This file has been migrated to modules/debug/.
;;
;; The module system now handles loading this configuration.
;; This file will be removed in a future version.
;;
;; Migration path:
;; - All functionality is now in modules/debug/init.el
;; - This file exists only for backward compatibility

;;; Code:

(warn "init-debug.el is deprecated; functionality has moved to modules/debug/")

(provide 'init-debug)

;;; init-debug.el ends here
